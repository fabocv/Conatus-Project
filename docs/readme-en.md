# Conatus-project 🌀

**Mathematical Modeling of the Power to Act and Affective Homeostasis.**

`conatus-project` is a TypeScript-based framework designed to quantify the **Tranquility Function (T)**. This project integrates **Spinozian Ethics**, **Deleuzian Ethology**, and contemporary **stress neurochemistry** into a dynamic systems model.

## The Concept
The model defines tranquility not as the absence of movement, but as a **resultant of existential efficiency**. A body is "tranquil" when its capacity to process reality outweighs the biological cost of existence.

### The T-Equation (v2.0)
$$T = \frac{S(\Gamma) \cdot [p(A \cdot D) - (1-p)(t + \ln(1/K))]}{F_{env} \cdot \Gamma}$$

Key Variables:
- **S (Subject):** Systemic integrity based on Physical ($\delta$) and Psychic ($\phi$) Autonomy.
- **Γ (Gamma):** Stress permeability (Cortisol/Allostatic Load).
- **p (Friction):** The capacity to act with presence and firmness.
- **K (Knowledge):** Cognitive power to integrate affects.

## Technical Features
- **Cluster Detection:** Automatic classification into dynamic regimes (K, L, M, N, O, P) based on sensitivity and response profiles.
- **Dissociation Analysis:** Identification of gaps between cognitive perception and actual somatic state.
- **Dysfunction Metrics:** Algorithmic detection of **Self-Exploitation** (performance at the expense of infrastructure) and **Self-Sabotage** (knowledge without action).

## ⚖️ Ethics and Scope
This software is an **affective mapping tool**. It does not provide clinical diagnoses. Its purpose is to offer coherence indicators so users and professionals can visualize stress nodes and power leakage points.
